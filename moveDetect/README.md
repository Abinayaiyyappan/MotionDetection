# Motion Detection Project

## Overview
The **Motion Detection Project** is an AI-powered application that detects movement in video feeds using Python and OpenCV. It analyzes frame differences to identify motion, making it useful for security surveillance, automation, and real-time monitoring.

## Features
- Detects motion in real-time from a live camera or video file.
- Highlights moving objects using bounding boxes.
- Adjustable sensitivity for different environments.
- Saves detection logs for future analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, imutils

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/motion-detection.git
   cd motion-detection
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy imutils
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the motion detection script:
   ```bash
   python motion_detection.py
   ```
2. The system will start detecting motion and display the output in a window.
3. Press **'q'** to exit the program.
